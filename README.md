Use string searching to quickly find specific data within a CSV. Perform various functions to help narrow down your search, export and share data. Quicklook works with a flat CSV database containing headers and rows. The headers must be in the first row followed by additional rows.

  - Search & Customize CSVs
  - Scan barcode to search
  - Sync with iCloud
  - watchOS Extension - sync lists to Apple Watch.

# ![Document](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/folder.png?raw=true) Document Browser
By clicking on the folder icon document browser will open and you can begin importing CSVs.  You can also share files by using Apple's built in 3D touch feature “peek and pop”.

# ![New CSV](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/plus.square.png?raw=true)New CSV
Create a new CSV by specifying headers.  After headers are created add content by pressing the + sign on the footer bar of the list view.

# ![Local File](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/circle.fill.png?raw=true)Local Files
Files marked with a filled circle are available locally on your device.

# ![Cloud Files](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/circle.png?raw=true) Cloud Files
Files marked with an empty circle are still in the cloud and will be synced when opening or pulling the file list down.

# ![Headers](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/rectangle.split.3x1.png?raw=true)Headers
After opening a file you can begin searching its contents using the search bar. You can specify which columns to view by pressing the headers button.

# ![Modify Header](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/pencil.circle.png?raw=true)Modify Header
While in the Column / Header selection view you can also modify header names by pressing the pencil with the circle with pencil.  For example, you could change Barcode to Asset Tag and Asset Serial No to Serial.  This is handy when CSVs are used for importing data to servers through scripts or applications that require specific header names on the CSV.

# ![Restore Header](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/pencil.circle.fill.png?raw=true)Restore Header
When a header is modified the circle will be filled in. You can change the header back to its default state by pressing the modify header button again.  The default header value will be displayed in the text field.  Press the check box next to the text field and the header will be restored.

# Aa Case Sensitivity
Toggle the A to turn case sensitivity on/off.  'A' performs a case sensitive search, 'a' will perform a case in-sensitive search.

# ![Save List](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/pin.png?raw=true)Save List
If you have search results you would like to export you can touch the pin and save the search results to a new file.

# ![Truncate List](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/rectangle.compress.vertical.png?raw=true)Truncate List
You can truncate search results and search new strings limited to the previous search. This is a non-destructive function that won’t affect the original CSV but is useful for narrowing down a search.

# ![Add Item](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/plus.png?raw=true)Add Item
Add new items to your list.  You must save the list using the Pin to keep any additions.

# ![Share Item](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/square.and.arrow.up.png?raw=true)Share Item
Quickly share specific row items.  If you press an item in your CSV list you will be taken to the item view and the share button will be displayed.

# ![Paste to Search](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/doc.on.clipboard.png?raw=true)Paste to Search
Within item view each header will be displayed with its associated value.  If you press any key / value pair in this view the value will be copied to the pasteboard.  Paste the value into the search bar by pressing the paste button located next to the search bar. The value is copied to the iOS pasteboard so you can paste the value into any field.

# ![Barcode](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/barcode.png?raw=true)Barcode
Scan barcodes into the Search Bar or into new textfields when creating lists by pressing and holding on the textfield to bring up a context menu presenting the Barcode Scanner.

# ![Text Scanner](https://github.com/mdoyle1/quicklookCSV/blob/master/sfsymbols/doc.text.viewfinder.png?raw=true)Text Scanner
Image to text is available by pressing and holding on the Search Bar textfield or an Add Item text field.
